    <string name="abstract_description">An abstract data type (ADT) is the way we look at a data structure, focusing on what it does
    and ignoring how ti does it job. For example, stacks and queues are perfect examples of an abstract data type. We can implement
    both these ADTs using an array or a linked list. This demonstrates the abstract nature of stacks and queue.</string>
