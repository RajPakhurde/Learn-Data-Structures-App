    </string>

    <string name="applications">‚≠êData structures are widely applied  in areas such as : \n 1. Compiler design \n 2. operating system
    \n 3. statistical analysis package \n 4. DBMS \n 5. numerical analysis \n 6. simulation \n 7. Artificial intelligence \n 8. Graphics</string>

    <string name="important_role">\t Data structures play an important role in DBMS. The major data structures used in the network data
        model are graphs. In the same way, hierarchical data model uses trees and RDBMS uses arrays.</string>

    <string name="algorithms">\t Algorithms are used to manipulate  the data contained in these data structures, as in searching
    and sorting. While working with data structures, algorithms are used to insert new data, search for a specified item, and delete
    a specific item.</string>
